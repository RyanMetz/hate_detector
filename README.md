# hate_detector
An implementation of a neural network topology for detecting offensive speech or  hate speech in tweets.

Not currently ready for prime time but neural net works as designed.

Words from tweets need to be embedded into 300 dimension vectors using the google news corpus with gensim. Work is ongoing.
